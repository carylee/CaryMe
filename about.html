    <h2>Hi, I'm Cary</h2>
    <p>
    I'm a student at Northwestern University studying vocal performance and
    computer science. I'm a hacker, a baritone, an LGBT + church activist,
    unicyclist, and lover of public transit.

    I grew up in Orlando but left the sweltering heat for <a

    Chicagoland in 2007.  Next fall, my boyfriend and I will move to Seattle where I will start real
    life working at Microsoft as a Software Design Engineer in Test (SDET) on the Windows Live team.
