title: Love Made Visible

I spent the summers of 2007 and 2008 serving on the leadership team at the
Warren W. Willis United Methodist Camp in Fruitland Park, Florida. At its core,
the job of a camp counselor is simple: to engage in relational ministry with
fourth through twelfth graders. Or, perhaps even more simply: to love the
campers.

As Stephen Colbert said in [his commencement speech at my
school](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJq8pB0ivMs "Northwestern
University Commencement Speech 2011") last year: "Service is love made
visible." In practice, loving campers means serving them.

Christ calls us to serve, to put the needs of another person or
community before our own.  At camp, service is leading a middle school
small group, teaching archery, and dancing with fourth graders at praise
time. At camp, service is plunging toilets, calming bed wetters, and
consoling homesick campers. At camp, service is spending the entire
summer after graduating high school away from your friends, giving up
the freedom of setting your own schedule (and sleep schedule), and doing
basically the same thing week after week while trying to make it fresh
and exciting for the kids. At camp, service is love made visible.

The success of the ministry of the Warren W. Willis United Methodist
Camp depends on willingness of the leadership team to serve. Likewise,
the success of the ministries of the First United Methodist Church of
Orlando as well as the greater United Methodist Church, depend on our
service, which we pledged in our membership vows. So go out, serve, and
make visible Christ's radically inclusive love in our church and our
community.
