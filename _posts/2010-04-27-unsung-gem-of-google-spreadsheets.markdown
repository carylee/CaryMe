title: Unsung Gem of Google Spreadsheets

The value of Google Docs is often judged in comparison to Microsoft
Office. I find that the places where Google Docs really excels are the
features that are unique to a cloud-based solution. The obvious feature
of this sort is the flagship feature of Google Docs: collaborative
editing.

Another cloud-unique feature that I find very useful is Google
Spreadsheets’ `=GoogleLookup("entity"; "attribute")` function. This
function, in [Google’s
words](http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=54199 "Google help document"), “attempts to find the values for
straightforward facts about specific things.”

To better showcase the feature, I’d like to explain how I used it last
night. For my astronomy homework, I wanted to do some spreadsheet
operations involving the atomic mass of elements present in our sun.

Instead of typing out all of those atomic weights myself—and risking
typing errors by doing so—I simply wrote the equation `=GoogleLookup(B2,
"Atomic weight")`. For this sort of simple factual lookup, Google was
literally able to fill in the blanks for me.

GoogleLookup is good for many situations where the answers are clear and
simple. I’ve also found it useful for applications involving zip codes.
It can definitely be a time saver.
